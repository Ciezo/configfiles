# My personal config files

These are my configurations and setup for Git and Powershell.

My <code>Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</code> is based on <a href="https://github.com/springcomp/my-box">springcomp/my-box></a> which is helpful as it can set up 
the Powershell and Windows Terminal to be productive and intuitive.

My <code>.gitconfig</code> is of course just aliases and stuff
